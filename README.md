## Introduction

Detailed project description.

## Requirements

Bullet points of the requirements.

## Setup

### Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrenoFariasDaSilva/Worked-Example-Miner-Candidates.git
cd Worked-Example-Miner-Candidates
```

### Dataset: Worked-Example Candidates

The candidates generated by the [Worked-Example-Miner tool](https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/Worked-Example-Miner) are located in the **"Candidates"** directory of this project. Within this directory, each processed repository has its own folder containing the files related to the candidates for that repository.

We rely heavily on community contributions to analyze these candidates and identify the most relevant ones for creating **Worked Examples** to enhance Computer Science education. 

#### How to Contribute:
1. **Analyze the Candidates**: Review the files in the "Candidates" directory.
2. **Submit Your Findings**: 
   - If you find a candidate valuable, move it to the **"Good Candidates"** directory.
   - If a candidate is not suitable, move it to the **"Bad Candidates"** directory.
   - If you're uncertain and want further input, move the candidate to the **"Double Review"** directory.
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit your changes with a clear description of your analysis.

The **"Good Candidates"** and **"Bad Candidates"** directories in the root of this project should only contain candidates that have already been reviewed and classified.

Your contributions play a key role in building a high-quality dataset that benefits the broader Computer Science community. Thank you for your support!
