**Worked-Example-Miner Candidates** is a collaborative project aimed at collecting and organizing candidates for the creation of **Worked Examples** in Computer Science. These candidates are generated by the [Worked-Example-Miner tool](https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/Worked-Example-Miner) and are categorized based on their relevance for educational purposes. 

The repository allows contributions from the community to review, analyze, and classify these candidates to identify the most valuable ones for teaching and learning. Contributors can classify candidates into different stages such as `awaiting review`, `under review`, `approved`, `discarded`, or `needing further review`.

Additionally, **Worked Examples** are created from the **approved candidates** to be used in Computer Science education.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrenoFariasDaSilva/Worked-Example-Miner-Candidates.git
cd Worked-Example-Miner-Candidates
```

## Dataset: Worked-Example Candidates

The candidates generated by the [Worked-Example-Miner tool](https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/Worked-Example-Miner) are located in the **"candidates"** directory of this project. Within this directory, each processed repository has its own folder containing the files related to the candidates for that repository.

We rely heavily on community contributions to analyze these candidates and identify the most relevant ones for creating **Worked Examples** to enhance Computer Science education.

### Directory Structure:
```plaintext
candidates/
│
├── awaiting_review/       # Candidates awaiting initial analysis.
├── under_review/          # Candidates currently being analyzed or discussed.
├── approved_candidates/   # Final candidates approved for Worked Examples.
├── discarded_candidates/  # Candidates determined to be unsuitable.
└── needs_further_review/  # Candidates requiring additional analysis.

worked_examples/           # Concrete Worked Examples created from the approved candidates.
```

## Worked-Example Candidates

This sections contains a markdown table with the current status of the candidates in the repository. The table is updated periodically to reflect the latest changes in the classification of candidates.

### How to Contribute:
1. **Analyze the Candidates**: Start by reviewing files in the "awaiting_review" directory.
2. **Move Candidates Based on Your Findings**:
   - If you are actively analyzing a candidate, move it to the "under_review" directory.
   - If you find a candidate valuable, move it to the "approved_candidates" directory.
   - If a candidate is not suitable, move it to the "discarded_candidates" directory.
   - If you're uncertain and want further input, move the candidate to the "needs_further_review" directory.
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit your changes with a clear description of your analysis and reasoning.

### Issue and PR Labeling:
When creating an **Issue** or **Pull Request (PR)** related to candidates, please ensure that it is labeled with the corresponding directory name from the following list:
- **awaiting_review**: For candidates that are awaiting initial analysis.
- **under_review**: For candidates currently being analyzed or discussed.
- **approved_candidates**: For candidates that have been thoroughly reviewed and approved for conversion into Worked Examples.
- **discarded_candidates**: For candidates that have been deemed unsuitable and should be excluded from further analysis.
- **needs_further_review**: For candidates that require additional analysis or discussion before making a final decision.
- **worked_examples**: For Issues/PRs related to the creation of Worked Examples from candidates in the **`approved_candidates`** directory.

This helps maintain a clear and organized flow throughout the process.

The organized classification of candidates helps streamline the process of building a high-quality dataset that benefits the broader Computer Science community. Thank you for your support!
